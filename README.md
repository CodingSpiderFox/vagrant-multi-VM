# Vagrant Multi VM Assignment

## About

This is going to be a project connecting several VM's together.

At this stage, one will host a forum or notebook website written in React. Another will host a node server with an express.js API connected to a mongoDB database (could host on another VM?). A third will have some form of print to pdf tool or some similar bulk processing of forum posts/notes.
